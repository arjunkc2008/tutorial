create a user and email
git config --global user.name "arjun"
git config --global user.email "arjunkc2008@gmail.com"

commands
git status =to know about the git dir status
git init= initialize a git directory in the current dir opened in bash
git add --a= add all the files to staging area , now see git status to see the message 
saying files to be commited but currently in staging area
git add first.txt= push first.txt to staging area since i modified the file
git commit -m "Initial Commit"= commit to the git repo
git log= show all previous commits
git diff= show diff bw working dir and staging area
git diff --staged = diff bw old commit and current staging area #
git commit -a -m "<comment>"= direct commit and skip the staging area
note= the above command only works modified files and does not work if
new file is created and not tracked

file statis lifecycle:
init-untracked(file now is tracked)-unmodified(now edit the file)-modified(use add --a)-staged

NOTE- ONCE THE FILES ARE IN STAGING AREA, IT WILL IGNORE IF THERE ARE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE FILE,
TO ADD THE MODIFIED FILE FOR STAGING AREA, AGAIN TYPE git add --a


GIT IGNORE

1)create .gitignore file= touch .gitignore
2)type the name of the file (ex. error.log) we want to ignore inside .gitignore file
3)now,any modification done to error.log file will not appear in git status
4)if want to ignore folders, then type folder_name/ in .gitignore file

NOTE- by deafault git ignores empty folder
